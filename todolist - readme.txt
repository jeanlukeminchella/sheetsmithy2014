TO DO LIST

this is the 2014 rules set
to "finish off" this set i would recommend the following

 - get a life? no ones coming back to this i predict - 20/05/2024
 - check the inputs i guess make it rock solid
 - change the "choices" array in the input to a "subclass" field. the only other choice coded in is the fight style for fighters and apaldins and stuff (default is defence)
 - have a think about scores / modifers as an input, that really is the benefit of the program over hard coded character sheets
 
then youre done! this 2014 rule set is great :)

now to do it again! :)
